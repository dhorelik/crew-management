# React assignment

#### Setup

  ```
  $ git clone git@github.com:dhorelik/crew-management.git
  $ cd crew-management
  $ npm install
  ```


#### Quick Start

`npm start` - Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

`npm run build` - Builds the app for production to the build folder.


#### Styling

The project is configured to support SAAS. Tere is an option to build css separately, but sass watcher and builder are baked into generic `build` & `start` commands. See `package.json` for reference.


#### Linting

ESLint is configured to provide linting (see the [eslint website](http://eslint.org) for details)

`npm run lint`


#### Type checking

Flow is configured to provide type checking for all files (see the [flow website](https://flow.org) for details). It's been setup to check all project files.

[Flow-typed](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed) is used to create library definitions for third-party libraries that were not written with Flow.


`npm run flow`


#### Tests

Jest is used as a testing platform (see the [jest website](https://jestjs.io) for details)

`npm test`


#### Deploy
