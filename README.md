# React assignment

#### Setup

  ```
  $ git clone git@github.com:dhorelik/crew-management.git
  $ cd crew-management
  $ npm install
  ```


#### Quick Start

`npm start` - Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

`npm run build` - Builds the app for production to the build folder.

`npm run lint`
